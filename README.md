# Pokemon_Java
A pokemon style game in java (discontinued, newer versions ported to D)

For obvious copyrights reasons this version does not include any art assets or music, as I used the ones found in the HG/SS roms.
The new D port will be uploaded to github once i get pokemon fights (the last missing major feature) running.
